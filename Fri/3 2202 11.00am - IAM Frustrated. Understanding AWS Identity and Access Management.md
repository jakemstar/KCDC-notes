IAM - "fancy string matching" (IAM team called it that lol)

Not statements work with principal where it will apply to every non match. Usually paired with deny otherwise could grant access to whole world except one person.

Can grant access to resource in your account but cannot grant access to action.

Cross account access must grant access to resource from account 1 then need to grant action in account 2

Service control policies don't affect external accounts. 

Reinforced that infra as code is the way to go
