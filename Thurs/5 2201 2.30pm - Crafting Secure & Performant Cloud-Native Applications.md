## Cloud native applications
- Designed and built to leverage and optimize cloud computing characteristics
- Built deployed & managed in cloud

## Cloud native architecture
- Loosely coupled
- Microservices
	- Small independent services that each focus on an individual problem
- Containerization
- Orchestration tooling
- APIs
- Service mesh
- CDN

## Cloud security challenges
- Difficulty monitoring and securing distributed components
- Ensuing secure and performant communication between services
- Isolating root causes can be hard bc rapid deployments
- Lack of visibility

## Security approaches
- Shift left 
	- integrating security practices as early as possible to catch errors before they happen
- DevSecOps
- organizational processes and practices
- **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**
	- Might be worth looking into

## Four Cs approach
- Security at each layer
- **Cloud/Infra layer**
	- Understand shared responsibility with cloud provider
	- Misconfigurations, data security, and automated attacks are biggest security risk.
	- What do
		- Continuous reviews
		- Data encrypted at rest
		- File integrity monitoring
		- Limit end user configurations for enterprise users in cloud platform
			- Default is usually bad. Very specific role based access
- **Cluster/Network layer**
	- Security of orchestration tooling (ie kubernetes)
	- Security of communication between services (encryption)
	- Authentication and auth for services (role based access)
	- What do
		- Encryption in transit
		- Event based architecture with intrusion detection
			- Monitor unusual amounts of traffic
		- WAF
		- Runtime independence
		- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Container layer**
	- Image security
	- Vulnerability and malware scanning
	- Isolation
	- Monitoring
	- What do
		- Vulnerability patching and scanning
			- Static code analysis before each build
			- Daily vulnerability scanning
- **Code layer**
	- Restrict exposed endpoints
	- Static code analysis

## Performance Approaches
- Container optimization
	- Recent versions of dependency
	- Remove unused deps
- Load balancing
- Caching
- Async processing
- Resource limits
- Service mesh
- Autoscaling
- CDN
- Monitoring

## Getting started
- What are we missing?
- Easiest to implement quickly?
	- Static code analysis
	- Automated vulnerability scanning
	- Logging and monitoring
	- Audit authentication and authorization practices (role based access control)
