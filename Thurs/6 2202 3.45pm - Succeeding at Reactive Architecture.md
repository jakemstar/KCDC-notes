Reactive manifesto

Reactive applications
use messaging to perform asynchronous messaging (message-driven architecture)
- message driven
- elastic
- responsive
- resilient

Call and return issues with objects
- "Feature Envy" in entity services
	- "here is an entity here are the operations on my entity and thats my microservice"
- End up with a "god" object that controls all other objects. high degree of behavior coupling.
	- IE in a store "cart" could become a god object
- RPC is synchronous, both parties must be active (http etc)
	- If one service goes down they're all down

"Dataflow programming"
- separate data from behavior

Flow based programming
- Paul Morrison

Use lookup tables

Autonomous component Pat Helland

If you have pricing module, send an event to catalogue whenever prices are updated, this way if pricing module/database goes down, prices are still available. Data is essentially cached immediately.

scale out not up
